<p>Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as Eminem (also stylized as EMINÆŽM), is an American rapper. He is credited with popularizing hip hop in Middle America and is regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time.[3] His global success is considered to have broken racial barriers to the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him a controversial figure, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as influencing many musical artists. His songs include "My Name Is", "The Real Slim Shady", "The Way I Am", "Stan", "Without Me", "Lose Yourself", "Mockingbird", "Not Afraid", and "Love the Way You Lie".</p>
